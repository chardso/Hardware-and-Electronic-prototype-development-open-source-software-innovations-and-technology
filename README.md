<h1>About</h1>

DIY audio means "do it yourself"rather than buying apiece of possibly expensive audio equipment such as a high-end audio amplifier or speaker, the person practicing DIY audio will make it by him/herself
The DIY ultra bass amplifier project  is an initiative by one long time experienced hardware expert  who targets  using the idea for passing over his big time electronic repair techniques , knowledge,and skills to refugees and other citizen youths who have failed to further their education due to lack of funds  for sustainability.

There are 7.1 million school-age refugee children around the world, and 3.7 million - more than half - don't have the opportunity to go to school. It gets progressively more difficult to access school as refugee children get older. Only 63% of refugee children are enrolled in primary school, compared to 91% globally.
﻿
Particularly in Adjumani district ,the total population shows that 232,400 are nationals and 207,500 are refugees and how ever most of refugees face hard time from hunger before they recieve the aid from United Nations High commision for refuguees \(UNHCR\)
﻿
﻿Though in 2019 alot of Non Governmental organizations were full in support of refugee education ,over these few years there is a decline in there activities.

﻿

From the link  above  there is a clear sign that with time world food programme will completely stop distribution of food rations to refugees and besides that the current ratio  per household can not sustain the household a whole month hence this calls for external funding to the rescue of the refugees.

if  the chance of funding is given to empower them through this type of projects to acquire;
﻿
- soldering skills
- General skills for repairing electronics and other hardware gadgets
would render them chances of putting the skills in practice to achieve litle household income for sustainability and the succesful ones would advance their skills with time. At least with the skills and knowledge on electronic repair ,the soldering skill alone can put food on the table,whatever i say in this making movement is what i have been through.
﻿
<h1>Team members</h1>
﻿Initiated the idea ,and joined by the students of junior express vocational training school during the critical making mentoring period and i was able to train atleast one member from each department ,they have driving department,tailoring ,saloon and hair dressing ,catering,carpentry and joinnery etc ,at least each member was able to acquire a soldering skill .their names are;

<h1>Project inspiration</h1>

- The unemployment rate in Uganda increased by 0.2 percentage points in 2021 in comparison to the previous year. In total, the unemployment rate amounted to 2.94 percent in 2021.2023
﻿
- The high youth unemployment levels in Uganda are partly because of the mismatch of courses taught by education institutions and the actual skills needed by the job market.
﻿
- The Youth in Adjumani district-northern Uganda are more vulnerable due to low education levels, high poverty and unemployment compared to their counterparts .
﻿
- Adjumani district hosting a great number of refugees from south sudan who were forced to leave their ancentral homes due to out break of war which has left sudan unsafe for a period of time .this has led to increased population with a great number of youths un educated and unskilled .
﻿
Students graduating from junior express vocational training school and have no start up capital to resume practicing the acquired skills.

<h1>Electronics and programming</h1>

***App***

- Graphical user interface (GUI)

<h2>Tool</h2>

- Commandline (CLI)

**For the code**
﻿
https://github.com/chardso/Building-a-DIY-audio-ultra-bass-amplifier.

***latest code***
﻿
https://wikifactory.com/+criticalmaking/a-diy-amplifier-building﻿

<h2>Assembly of the project</h2>
﻿
- Obtaining the size of the area of the box by the prototype size

- Not only boxes but also wasted plastics eg jerricans,basins can be cut according to the surface area of the prototype.

- Apply pertex on the selected area where the shock absorber can sit firmly,not only pertex but also other solutions that can join the alluminium with the material used to design the outer perimetre ot the prototype .

- Align the prototype considering the alluminium surface sits on the area applied with pertex but remember it's applied on the two surfaces and left to drain for 5-10mins.
﻿
- Seal the box ,but remember the vaccum left should be filled with cut boxes which would give the uniform shape of the amplifier,not only cut boxes the white material which normally comes in the box whenever one buys a new radio can be used to close up the vaccum.

- Identify the area for passage of aux,Dc powerline and speaker line as shown and indicated above in the picture.

<h2>problems faced during the implementation of the project</h2>

- Hight material costs  due to delayed entry funding ,by the time we recieved funds,the mentoring program had already started and this couldn't enable us travel to the main city to acquire the materials at the reduced costs otherwise the budget for materials was enough and that could purchase materials which could run the project successful and excess would  be used for training the team for the whole year otherwise in our locality material costs have been doubled.

- Transport limitations also affected the implimentation of this project as in there was no transport budgets enabling access of distant refugee settlements though they have shown great interest in empowering them with knowledge in creative innovations like building led light systems,small hand radios prototypes and solar chargers since they face a challenge of power for reading books and charging their phones.

***led light for reading books***
﻿
***solar chargers for charging phones***

***Radio transmitter***
- Network limitations,sometimes we could access the mentoring because of network breakages.
- Lack of a nearby makerspace which could host and train/empower those out of school.
- Limited training gadgets eg laptops,cameras as aresult it has led to poor quality images and videos and most of the refugees need empowerment in digital literacy.

<h2>Social  Impact of the project on the maker</h2>
- Established the network with other greater maker both mentors and mentees and gained alot of experience in project presentation ,SDG application,license ,and documentations using different softwares e.g wikifactory and github.
- Linked to alot of organisations with great minds involved sharing great ideas via open source softwares educating communities in several fields such as innovations,interpreneurship,organisational development programmes all aimed at changing livelihood of communities.
<h1>Social and Environmental Impact</h1>
- No carbon footprint, no water (moisture) print and no aquatic toxicity through proper disposal and recycling techniques.
- Aligned with the UN's Sustainable Development Goals

<h2>project impact to students of the vocational training school</h2>
- students have acquired soldering skills and are now able to solder carbon brashes fo vehicles,motocycles ,coils ,electronic part fixing like speakers,screens,earpiece,mouthpiece etc.
- They have also been in position to identify sound production electronic components used in this project such as droppers,resistors,to mention but a few.

<h2>Call for Action</h2>
- Refugee community in the nearby settlement suggests we prototype simple hand radios for them to access area dailly news.
- project test continuation and improvements like including the DC unit are in plan and team project members are yet to present their prototypes of their respective foculties are also underway but how to go about requires external funding.
- Agreat population of both refugees who are school dropouts are interested in the project but due to lack of a nearby makerspace ,their interest has been turned down

Empowering the Ukrainian displaced people through innovations and technology for sustainability 

# ![](/Images/IMG_20220207_134319_459.jpg)

<h2>project inspiration</h2> 

When there is insurgency or outbreak of war, the citizens of that particular area are displaced from their ancestral homes and deprived of their basic needs such as food,shelter,health and education and seek for refugee resulting to growth of unskilled population, poverty,bad health,insecurity and hunger eg the current situation in Sudan,the war between tribes has forced netzens to quit their ancestral homes for refugee in it's neighboring boarder countries like Uganda, Ethiopia to mention but a few, Ukraine is also undergoing the same situation. 
# ![](/Images/images.jpg)
The recent news report by World Food programm giving a signal of another decreament in refugee food rations and yet the monthly ration can not even feed the refugee household for thirty days. 

https://www.wfp.org/news/wfp-cuts-refugees-food-rations-uganda-funding-declines#:~:text=This%20year%20has%20been%20particularly,over%20the%20next%20six%20months.

This was during COVID-19 in the year 2020 indicating that supporting refugees with food rations is a good idea but not reliable than we could empower them with hardware and Electronic repair skills for their sustainability.
